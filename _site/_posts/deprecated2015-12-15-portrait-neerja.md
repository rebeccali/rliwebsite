*All pictures taken with a Nikon D7100 and Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 lens*

Over the semester I've picked up more and more photography as a hobby. Ever since I started borrowing my friend's very pretty camera, I've started taking pictures of everything.
The most interesting part is how you can make pictures more beautiful than real life. The unadulterated RAWs are often not gorgeous, but even then, they capture more detail than I can take in one moment. The pictures are further enhanced by using a photo editor to bring out color where there was none, set mood, tone - everything. I stopped believing that photos are anything close to reality anymore.

I decided to take photos of my friend, Neerja, and see whether I could capture some stellar shots. Some of these are good, some have poor composition, some were just experiments. I tried my best to get a few with the "Senior portraits" feel along with a few that are just aesthetic. As a model, Neerja was very energetic. This was both bad and good. Sometimes she made it hard to get a shot at the right angle, for as quickly as the angle came she moved. She did provide a lot of inspiration with her movements, but it led to many blurred shots. My retention rate for photos ended up being less than 5% - fairly abyssal. In the future, I intend to give models more direction in pose and staying still, darn it! (or get faster autofocus)
