![ABC XYZ block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/lovehatecompiulation.png) <small>Block with dual words</small>

This is a block that I made with [OpenSCAD, a code-based 3D solid modeler][openscad]. The basic idea behind OpenSCAD is using a set of primitive shapes (cubes, spheres) and boolean operations (union, difference, intersection) in order to make a complex shape. For this operation, [OpenSCAD][openscad] has an additional font primitive which this model takes advantage of. It is the intersection of "LOVE" and "HATE" rotated about the same axes. The basic code is below:

	font = "Consolas:style=Bold";

	intersection() {
	    rotate(90, [1, 0, 0])   linear_extrude(height=1) text("LOVE", font = font, size = 1, spacing=.7);
	    translate ([0,-1, 0])   linear_extrude(height=1) text("HATE", font = font, size = 1, spacing=.7);
	}


It was inspired by the Godel Escher Bach book cover, which is a book written a little too much in a Malcolm Gladwell-esque style for me to read past the first few pages. Maybe one day I will go read it and not have this opinion.
