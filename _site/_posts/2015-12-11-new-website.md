Blogs are like keeping a small animal. Occasionally you have to feed them. Occasionally you have to maintain their appearance, and occasionally they're a pain in the ass to do so. My previous website was built on [Anchor CMS][anchorcms], an unwieldy heavy website for *beautiful blogging*. A SQL server later, I had Anchor running with a metric ton of backend and little bits of PHP.

Since then I've looked around at a few websites and came across [Jekyll][jekyll], an extremely reasonable static website platform with little backend to speak of. It took 20 minutes to set up the first local instance, and now this website is running. Some features I enjoy:

* Static pages
* Markdown syntax
* Strong community of developers who write clean code
* Command-line local instances, as well as interfacing well with [Github Pages][githubpages]

I would also like to credit [Holo Alfa][holoalfa] as the theme I am using, which is clean, responsive, and easy to manage. Their page has a great description of how to spin up their page as well as [Jekyll][jekyll] in under thirty minutes. That is, if you don't futz around with colors for ages like me!
